# ChillBot

## What am I?

Hi!
I'm a bot made to annoy people!  
I have so many ways to annoy anyone who sees me!
I promise to make you laugh a lot. If not, please don't let me know, I'm sensible to this kind of stuff.

## How to contribute

I'm open to any suggestions! If you have some, just add a issue requesting a feature. It would be my duty to read and add what seems interesting.

Otherwise just fork the repo and make a pull request.
